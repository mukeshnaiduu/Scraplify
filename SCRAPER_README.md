# Enhanced Job Scraper

This update enhances the job scraper to extract comprehensive descriptions and required skills from individual job pages on devsunite.com.

## Features Added

1. **Detailed Job Descriptions**: The scraper now navigates to individual job detail pages to extract full job descriptions.

2. **Skills Extraction**: The scraper can now extract skills required for each job from the detail pages.

3. **Improved Link Detection**: Enhanced the link extraction to better identify "View Details" links.

4. **Robust Error Handling**: Added better error logging and exception handling for more reliable scraping.

5. **Integrated Testing**: Created dedicated test files to verify the enhanced functionality.

## Usage Instructions

### Run the Scraper

To run the job scraper with detailed extraction:

```bash
cd /workspaces/Scraplify/backend
python manage.py scrapejobs
```

To limit the number of jobs scraped:

```bash
python manage.py scrapejobs --limit 5
```

To skip detailed page scraping (faster but less comprehensive):

```bash
python manage.py scrapejobs --skip-details
```

### Test the Enhanced Functionality

Test the job details extraction:

```bash
cd /workspaces/Scraplify/backend
python test_job_details.py
```

Test with a specific job URL:

```bash
python test_job_details.py --job-url https://devsunite.com/jobs/example-job-id
```

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
python test_scraper.py --all
```
